## How to Study

All of the exercises & examples in this repository are plain JS files that will work anywhere ES6 JavaScript will run.  The simplest way to study the code in this repository is to run the files in node, using the terminal and debugger built into VSC. Or ...

### `index.html`

Each directory in this repository contains an `index.html` file.  To step through the code in your browser's debugger or JS Tutor, open one of the `index.html` files with `liveServer`.  The live page will have a button for each javascript file in this repository.  One button will load the most recent code from VSC in the debugger, the other button will open the most recent code in a new JS Tutor tab.

Happy studying!

## Reviewing your Work

> :warning: Open [./review.js](./review.js) and replace `hackyourfuturebelgium` with your GitHub user name in the `CONFIG` object! :warning:

It's not enough to pass the tests once and move on!

You will need to come back to review your exercises (all of them, not just these `:)`) over the coming months and year if you want to stay sharp and remember everything you've learned.

### `review.js`

To help you and your coaches review your exercises there is a file in this repository named `review.js`.  When you run it node from the top level of this folder (`$ node review.js`), it will evaluate each .js file in this repo and report the results for easy reviewing.

You should run this script before pushing your code so you and your coaches can more easily review your work directly from GitHub.  But you may also find it helpful to run the script at the end of each study session to help you pick up where you left off.

### [`REVIEW.md`](./REVIEW.md)

In each folder, the `review.js` script will create a new `REVIEW.md` file.  This file will contain:

* The name of the directory
* The status of the directory (pass, fail, error, ...)
* The date and time of the last evaluation
* Links to all files & sub-directories in the folder (including their status)
* A section for each .js file including
  * the name of the file
  * the status of the file (pass, fail, error, ...)
  * any assertions and/or errors
  * a copy of the code that was evaluated
  * a link to the most recent code hosted on GitHub
